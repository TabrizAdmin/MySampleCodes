# MySampleCodes

<p>This is my sample codes parts from one of my international works based on laravel framework.</p>
<p>This project is not the full project and it is related only some little parts of project to see my coding style.</p>
<p>This includes codes sample from Broadcasting, Events, Controllers, Jobs, User Model and one service</p>
<p>The design pattern that I used was MVSC (adding service layer into MVC)</p>
